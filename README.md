# Spam Detection Project

This project shows how to use the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect spam messages.

## Files

- `naive_bayes_codes.py` - Uses a real dataset to train and test a spam detection model.
- `naive_bayes_code_1.py` - A small example to understand how the model works.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries: pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Put the `spam.csv` file in the same folder as the code.
4. Run the code using: naive_bayes_codes.py and naive_bayes_code_1.py

This project is for learning and practice.
